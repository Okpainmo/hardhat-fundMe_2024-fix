# A very crucial 2024 fix for chapter 7(the Hardhat FundMe chapter) of Patrick Collins' and FreeCodeCamp's full-blockchain-solidity-course-js - (Hardhat Javascript Edition)

This project is a very crucial 2024 fix for chapter 7(the Hardhat fundMe chapter) of Patrick Collins' and FreeCodeCamp's full-blockchain-solidity-course-js - Hardhat Javascript Edition. I spent hours verifying, adding notes, fixing bugs, and making changes, so as to make the project work alright, and be compatible with Ethers v6(precisely v6.11.1).

## Important Notes.

1. Package manager used: NPM.
2. I only fixed the main(Javascript) branch. I'm yet to do so for the Typescript branch.

## Areas covered.

I did a great job covering as much of the project as possible. Including areas like:

1. The smart contracts.
2. Testing(unit test, and staging test).
3. Linting(with solhint).
4. Gas reporting.
5. Test coverage reporting.
6. Contract verification, and more - basically everything I guess.

I'll really love to contribute to the main project repository, but I might not get the leisure of time to do that. Please feel free to do so if you can. I'll certainly do whenever I'm able.

You can also contribute to this repo(especially the README file) to make it more navigable and easily understandable. PRs are welcomed.

Please feel free to share this repo as much as you can and save folks the pain of hitting so many errors as a result of the breaking changes that occurred since after the course was recorded/released.

CheersðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.
